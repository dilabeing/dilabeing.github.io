  <h3>NTU Electrical And Electronic Engineering</h3>
  <p id="doc"></t>The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering was one of the three founding schools of Nanyang Technological University, then known as Nanyang Technological Institute which was set up in 1981. Now, the School is one of the component schools under the renowned College of Engineering together with five other engineering schools namely, Chemical & Biomedical Engineering, Civil & Environmental, Computer, Mechanical & Aerospace and Materials Science & Engineering.<br><br>

</t>The School offers two 4-year Direct Honours professional degree programmes - Electrical & Electronic Engineering and Information Engineering & Media. The number of graduates has steadily increased over the years, from the first batch of 194 in 1985 to about 800 today. The School is one of the largest schools in Electrical & Electronic Engineering in the world. In addition to its undergraduate programmes, the School offers 7 MSc programmes by coursework and the MEng & PhD degrees by research.<br><br>

</t>The School has about two hundred faculty with broad and varied background and strong research and professional expertise. They are supported by more than four hundred research, technical and administrative staff members. Apart from teaching the undergraduate and graduate courses, faculty members are active in research and development, engaging in a broad range of collaborations with renowned overseas universities, research institutes and multinational companies.<br><br></p>
